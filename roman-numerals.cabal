description:
  This library provides functions for parsing and pretty printing
  Roman numerals. Because the notation of Roman numerals has varied
  through the centuries this package allows for some customisation
  using a configuration that is passed to the conversion
  functions. Exceptions are dealt with by wrapping the results of
  conversions in the error monad.
